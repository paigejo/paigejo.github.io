  A teacher is not just responsible for teaching the subject material of a course, but also why that material is important, useful, and interesting. Luckily, I happen to believe that statistics is all of those things. Since statistics is often used by many non-statisticians it is also important for statistics to be accessible and tuned to a variety of interests. Since I have taught a variety of courses and have tutored students from many different background, I try my best to use that experience to improve my teaching to be inclusive to many different and diverse audiences. Aside from private tutoring, some courses I have taught or have been a TA for are shown below.</small></p>
