  <p class="lead">
  I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Statistics group in the Department of Mathematical Sciences <a href = "https://www.ntnu.edu/imf">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I teach statistics courses at NTNU and also spend some of my time on research, studying small area estimation and accounting for positional error in spatial models with 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a>, 
    <a href = "https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/geir-arne.fuglstad">Geir-Arne Fuglstad</a>, and 
    <a href = "https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/andrea.riebler">Andrea Riebler</a>. 
In addition to my work on small area estimation and positional error, my research interests include Bayesian statistics, computational statistics, survey statistics, and integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). <br/>
<br/>
Before coming to NTNU, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Washington under Jon Wakefield, and my B.A. in Applied Math and Statistics at Macalester College.
