  <p class="lead">
  I am an Associate Professor in the Statistics group in the <a href = "https://www.ntnu.edu/imf">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I teach statistics courses at NTNU and also spend some of my time on research, studying small area estimation, statistical validation in spatial contexts, and accounting for positional error in spatial models. In general, my research interests include spatial statistics, small area estimation, Bayesian statistics, computational statistics, and integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). <br/>
<br/>
Before starting as a professor at NTNU, I also did a postdoc here, received my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Washington under Jon Wakefield, and my B.A. in Applied Math and Statistics at Macalester College.
