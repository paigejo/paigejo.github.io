    My research interests lie in small area estimation, spatial statistics, computational statistics, and Bayesian inference. Most recently, I have been working on accounting for positional error in spatial models, and on developing new methods for statistical validation in a spatial context. I am also interested in statistics applications in the earth sciences.
    I have been involved in helping to develop both the SUMMER and fields packages in R. SUMMER (Spatio-Temporal Under-Five Mortality Methods for Estimation) is a package for spatio-temporal smooth of complex survey data, and fields and a package with classical methods for spatial statistics modeling and spatial data visualization.
    I am always interested in forming new collaborations, including interdisciplinary ones. If this is something you are interested in, please <a class = "active" href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
