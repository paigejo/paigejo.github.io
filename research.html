<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Research</h1>

  <p class = "lead"><small>I specialize in spatial and spatiotemporal statistics, and am currently studying 
    computational statistics, Bayesian statistics, INLA, small area estimation, and survey statistics. In particular, 
    I am interested in the intersection between survey and spatial statistics and in the properties of 
    areal aggregation incontinuous spatial models.
    I have also studied social aggregation and swarm behavior, inverse modeling of earthquake coseismic slips with 
    paleoseismic data, climate feedback modeling, under-5 mortality estimation, and have worked on developing open 
    source statistical software in R on both GitHub and CRAN.
    My <a class="active" href="cv.html">my CV</a> gives more information on my research, publications, 
    presentations, and software.</small></p>
