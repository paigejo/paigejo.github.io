<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Master's Project and Thesis Proposals</h1>

<p class="lead"><small>
  I am interested in spatial and spatiotemporal methods and their applications, 
  and have a number of potential projects for interested Master's and 
  Bacchelor's students, shown below. Please <a href = "https://paigejo.github.io/contact.html">contact me</a> if you are interested.

<h4 style="margin-top:0">Inferring Historical Magnitude 9 Earthquake Coseismic Slip Distributions Using Paleoseismic Evidence</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is a 1,000 km long fault off the west coast of North America stretching from northern California in the US to Vancouver Island, Canada. The CSZ is capable of producing magnitude 9 earthquakes, but it has not experienced one since 1700. In order to assess risk due to future earthquakes, it is therefore necessary to use historic rather than modern evidence. One such source of evidence is estimates of paleoseismic subsidence along the coast, where carbon dated measurements of how much the ground sank as a result of past earthquakes can be used to infer how large the associated earthquakes were, and where along the coast risk from future earthquakes is highest.

<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
This project will involve “inverse modeling” of earthquake spatial slip distributions using a combination of 1) existing Python code from R for a “forward model” that predicts subsidence given an input earthquake, and 2) a spatial model for CSZ earthquakes. The student would primarily be responsible for updating the forward model. Depending on time, the forward model will also need to be linked to the statistical earthquake model to assess the size and spatial distribution of past and future earthquakes, which could result in a paper in a peer reviewed journal.

<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
A strong statistical background is required, along with strong programming experience in R and ideally some programming experience in Python as well. Some understanding of spatial statistics would be ideal, but not necessary.
